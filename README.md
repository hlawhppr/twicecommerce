# TwiceCommerce Pricing 2026: Free Trial, Affordable Plans, All-in-One Rental & Resale Platform

So you're running a rental business—or thinking about starting one—and you're drowning in spreadsheets, double bookings, and payment headaches. I get it. Been there, watched enough small business owners suffer through it.

Then someone tells you about TwiceCommerce (formerly known as Rentle), and you're wondering: is this actually worth it, or just another SaaS platform promising the moon?

Let me tell you what I found after digging into this thing.

<img width="3550" height="1673" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51f17342-a65b-48ca-a70d-75f9688a2c40" />

## What Actually Is TwiceCommerce?

Here's the short version: TwiceCommerce is basically an operating system for circular commerce. You know, the whole rent-sell-subscribe game. It's designed for businesses that want to make money from products more than once—whether you're renting out kayaks, reselling secondhand outdoor gear, or running subscription boxes.

Founded in 2018 in Helsinki, the company rebranded from Rentle to TwiceCommerce recently. The name change makes sense when you think about it—"twice" because you're selling the same product twice (or more). Pretty straightforward.

What caught my attention is that they're not trying to be everything to everyone. They're focused on rental and resale businesses, from tiny one-person operations to big retail chains like Decathlon UK and Motonet in Finland.

## The Real Deal: What Does It Actually Do?

Alright, let's get into the meat of it.

**The Basics Everyone Needs:**
- Online store builder (no coding required, thank god)
- Inventory management that actually prevents double bookings
- Built-in payment processing
- Automated customer emails
- Order management for both online and walk-in customers

**The Stuff That Makes Life Easier:**
You can set up rentals, one-time sales, AND subscriptions all in the same product catalog. So if you want to let people rent a bike, buy it outright, or subscribe monthly—you can do all three without juggling different systems.

The inventory tracking is pretty clever. It knows when something's rented out, when it needs maintenance time, and when it's available again. No more accidentally booking the same kayak to three different customers.

**Integration Game:**
They've got native integration with Wix (which is huge if you're already on that platform), plus webhooks for Zapier and Make if you want to automate stuff. Payment-wise, you can use their built-in TWICE Payments (if you're in Europe) or connect Stripe.

One thing users seem to love: you can embed their booking system right into your existing website. You don't have to rebuild everything from scratch.

## TwiceCommerce Pricing Breakdown 2026

Here's where it gets interesting. They've got four plans, and honestly, the pricing structure is pretty transparent.

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (Save 25%) | Best For | Payment Processing Fees |
|------|--------------|------------------------|----------|------------------------|
| **Discover** | $39/mo | $29/mo | Businesses under $40K/year turnover |  [3.4% + $0.45 (TWICE Payments)](https://www.twicecommerce.com) or 2.0% (Stripe) |
| **Build** | $92/mo | $69/mo | Businesses under $300K/year turnover |  [2.4% + $0.35 (TWICE Payments)](https://www.twicecommerce.com) or 1.0% (Stripe) |
| **Advance** | $479/mo | $359/mo | Up to 5 locations, $300K+ turnover |  [1.4% + $0.25 (TWICE Payments)](https://www.twicecommerce.com) or 0.5% (Stripe) |
| **Enterprise** | Starting $2,000/mo | Annual contracts only | Large multi-location businesses | Custom volume-based rates |

**Special Offer for New Users:**
- 3-day free trial (no credit card required)

**Build Plan ($69-92/mo):**

The smart thing they did? No setup fees on any plan. And you can upgrade or downgrade whenever you want if you're on a monthly plan.

## Hidden Costs and Fine Print

Let's talk about what they DON'T shout about on the pricing page.

**Transaction Fees:**
These payment processing fees add up. If you're doing $10K/month in sales on the Discover plan, that's $340 in fees (using TWICE Payments at 3.4%). On the Build plan, same sales would cost you $240. 

Do the math—sometimes upgrading to a more expensive plan actually saves you money if your transaction volume is high enough.

**What's NOT Included:**
- Additional store locations cost extra (only 1 included on Discover/Build, up to 5 on Advance)
- If you need more than 22 languages... actually, they support 22 languages max
- PCI compliance audit costs (though TWICE itself is Level 1 PCI DSS compliant)

**The Stripe vs. TWICE Payments Decision:**
TWICE Payments is only available in Europe. Outside Europe, you'll use Stripe, which has its own fees on top of TWICE's commission. The commission structure is actually better than it looks because manual payment options have ZERO processing fees—you just handle the payment yourself.

## Real User Reviews: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly

I dug through hundreds of reviews across Capterra, GetApp, and Software Advice. Here's what actual users are saying (not the cherry-picked marketing stuff).

### The Praise

People genuinely love a few specific things:

**"I was able to set up my store and start renting online in less than 30 minutes."** This comes up A LOT. The onboarding is apparently stupid-simple.

**Customer Support:** Multiple reviews mention "superb support" and "never experienced such a great attitude from support people." The team responds fast, and they actually seem to care.

**The Free Plan:** Small businesses are thrilled that the free version has enough features to actually run a business. One user said, "The Free version has a lot of features for my small company. I'd definitely purchase a paid version as I scale up."

**Inventory Management:** No more double bookings. This alone is worth it for most rental businesses.

### The Complaints

Nothing's perfect. Here's what ticked people off:

**Pricing Flexibility Issues:** One boat rental owner complained they couldn't set different prices for different times of year or days of the week. That's rough for seasonal businesses.

**Limited Customization:** The booking calendar and online store customization options are pretty basic. If you want a super polished, highly customized look, you might be frustrated.

**Reporting Limitations:** Several users mentioned the reporting tools are "extremely limited" compared to more expensive alternatives.

**Transaction Fee Surprise:** A few users weren't happy about TWICE's additional surcharge on top of Stripe fees. The feeling of being "locked in" to a payment processor bothered some folks.

**Feature Gaps:** Can't take inventory out of service for scheduled maintenance without creating fake bookings (that's a workaround, not a solution). Product packaging only works for individual items, not for packages themselves.

### The Realistic Take

From what I can tell, TwiceCommerce works best for:
- Small to medium rental businesses getting started
- Retailers adding rental/resale as a new revenue stream
- People who value simplicity over infinite customization
- Businesses that need something working TODAY, not in six months after custom development

It's probably NOT ideal for:
- Huge enterprises needing complex custom integrations (unless you go Enterprise)
- Businesses requiring extremely flexible dynamic pricing
- Companies that need pixel-perfect custom design

## Who's Actually Using This Thing?

The customer list is pretty diverse:

**Big Names:**
- Decathlon UK (sporting goods rental)
- Motonet (Finland's leading automotive/DIY retail chain)
- Rab (outdoor equipment rental in the UK)
- Scandinavian Outdoor (camping gear rentals)

**Small Operators:**
- Kayak rental shops
- Bike rental companies
- Trailer hire businesses
- Camera and AV equipment rentals
- Ski equipment rentals

What's interesting is that the platform scales from a solo kayak rental operation to a 39-store retail chain (Motonet). That's not common in the SaaS world—most tools are good at one end or the other, not both.

## 2026 Promo Codes and Deals

Here's the thing about promo codes for TwiceCommerce—they don't really do traditional discount codes like consumer brands. The platform itself allows businesses to CREATE discount codes for their customers, but TwiceCommerce doesn't offer many promotional discounts for the software itself.

**What You CAN Get:**

✅ **3-day free trial** - No credit card required  
✅ **First month for $1** - Available for Discover and Build plans  
✅ **25% off** - When paying annually instead of monthly (applies to all plans)  
✅ **14-day free trial** - Via Wix App Market installation

That's basically it. No BLACKFRIDAY30 codes or anything like that.

The annual discount is the real savings. On the Build plan, you're looking at $828/year instead of $1,104 if you pay annually. That's $276 in savings.

## The Wix Integration: Game Changer or Gimmick?

If you're already using Wix for your website, this integration is honestly pretty slick.

You can download the TWICE Rentals App from the Wix App Market and boom—you've got rental functionality built right into your Wix site. It uses Wix's checkout and delivery features, so the experience is seamless for customers.

But heads up: Wix users get a 14-day free trial instead of the 3-day trial, and the $1 first-month deal doesn't apply through Wix. You go straight to regular pricing after the trial.

If you're NOT on Wix, TwiceCommerce still offers embedding options so you can integrate the booking system into basically any website builder.

## Features That Actually Matter

Let me cut through the marketing fluff and tell you what features actually make a difference day-to-day:

**Automated Availability Calculation:**  
This is huge. The system automatically knows what's available when, accounting for rental periods, maintenance time, and buffer periods. No manual calendar updating.

**Multiple Business Models in One Platform:**  
Seriously underrated feature. You can offer the same product for rent, for purchase, or as a subscription. Try doing that with most rental software.

**Walk-In + Online Order Management:**  
You can create orders for walk-in customers directly from the admin panel, then send them a booking link via email or SMS for confirmation and payment. This is perfect if you're running a physical store alongside your online presence.

**Barcode Scanning:**  
Available on Advance and Enterprise plans. Makes inventory counts and order returns way faster if you've got a lot of items moving.

**Webhooks and API:**  
If you're technical, these open up a LOT of automation possibilities. Connect to Zapier or Make and you can build pretty sophisticated workflows.

**POS Integration:**  
Built-in integrations with Solteq Commerce Cloud and Tekso POS for automated payment sync. Great for retail stores expanding into rentals.

## Is It Worth It? The Bottom Line

Here's my honest take.

**You should probably try TwiceCommerce if:**
- You're starting a rental business from scratch
- You're a retailer adding rentals or resale to your existing business  
- You value time-to-market over perfect customization
- You want one system for online and in-person sales
- You need something that "just works" without a huge learning curve
- Your business is under $300K/year in revenue (the Build plan is a sweet spot)

**Look elsewhere if:**
- You need super complex pricing rules and seasonal variations
- You want pixel-perfect custom design control
- You're doing $10M+/year and need enterprise-grade reporting
- You require integrations with obscure industry-specific tools
- You prefer to own and host your own infrastructure

**The Pricing Sweet Spot:**

For most small to medium businesses, the Build plan at $69/mo (annual) is probably the right choice. You get enough inventory capacity (5,000 items), better payment processing rates, and the features you actually need without overpaying for stuff you won't use.

If you're just testing the waters or doing less than $40K/year, start with Discover at $29/mo (annual). The free trial and $1 first month make it basically risk-free to try.

## How to Get Started

The process is dead simple:

1. 👉 [Sign up for the free 3-day trial](https://www.twicecommerce.com) (no credit card needed)
2. Set up your product catalog (they have templates)
3. Configure your pricing and rental terms
4. Customize your store design
5. Connect your payment processor
6. Go live

If you want to lock in the annual discount, you can do that right from the settings after you sign up.

For the first month after the trial, you'll only pay $1 if you choose Discover or Build. That's basically a month to fully test the platform with real customers before committing to full price.

## Final Thoughts

Look, I'm not here to sell you on TwiceCommerce if it's not right for your business. There are definitely scenarios where you'd be better off with a custom solution or a different platform.

But for the vast majority of rental and resale businesses—especially those just starting out or looking to add these revenue streams—TwiceCommerce hits a sweet spot of simplicity, features, and pricing that's hard to beat.

The fact that you can literally go from signup to taking real customer orders in under an hour is powerful. Most SaaS platforms promise that; TwiceCommerce actually delivers it based on what users are saying.

The customer support reputation is solid, the platform is actively improving (check their product updates at updates.twicecommerce.com), and the pricing is transparent with no sneaky gotchas.

Is it perfect? No. The reporting could be better, the customization options could be deeper, and the pricing rules could be more flexible.

But perfect is the enemy of good enough. And for most rental businesses, TwiceCommerce is way more than good enough—it's actually pretty great.

👉 [Start your free 3-day trial](https://www.twicecommerce.com) and see for yourself. Worst case, you waste a few hours. Best case, you find the solution that finally makes your rental business run smoothly.
